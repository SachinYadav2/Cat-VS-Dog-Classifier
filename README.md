<h2>A basic HTML table</h2>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Model</th>
    <th>Accuracy</th>
    <th>Validation_Accuracy</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CNN</td>
    <td>0.93</td>
    <td>0.81</td>
  </tr>

    <td>ANN</td>
    <td>Total Epoch 30</td>
    <td>Loss 0.2117</td>
  </tr>

<p>THis Project is Basicalyy End to End Project</p>
<p>I Created A website To predict a Dog Vs Cat </p>
<p>Then I Deploy This Project A AWS server With Ec2 Instance</p>
<p>Inside the EC2 I used A ubantu os </p>

<h1>Image Classification Task </h1>
<h3>Note- We are train the model only image Data Set And Image Data set inside may we a one or more class possible but image classification throw you don not perform image  localization task but some alternative are present(Face Hard Class) </h3>
<h1>Image Classification give a alway Integer in My CASE Zero means Dog And One means Cat (these zero and one are basically depend ont data preprocesing time)</h1>
